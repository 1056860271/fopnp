Subject: Introduction to e-mail

Each e-mail stored on this server is plain ASCII without MIME or other
adornments, which we consider a distraction from the beauty of simple
and straightforward text.  Your e-mail folder is stored in the old
"mbox" format to make it easy to use "grep" and other commands beloved
of e-mail power users.
