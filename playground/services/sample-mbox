Subject: Introduction to e-mail

Each e-mail stored on this server is a plain text document without MIME
or other adornments, which we consider a distraction from the beauty of
simple and straightforward verbage.  It is stored in the old "mbox"
format to make it easy for "grep" and other e-mail power commands.
